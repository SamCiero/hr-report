# Workplace Issues Report  

**Location:** Franchised store, Alabama  
**Timeline:** Approximately 9 months (continuing)  
**Primary Parties Involved:**  
- **Brad (GM)** — General Manager  
- **Savannah (AM1)** — Assistant Manager, externally hired 9 months ago  
**Supporting Evidence:** Multiple witness accounts (staff and management) available to corroborate incidents.  

---

## 1. Origin of Favoritism  
Approximately one month after Savannah’s hiring, she openly told four staff members, an AM3, and me that she was sexually involved with Brad. These conversations continued for several weeks until she later told people she ended the relationship.  

I raised concerns directly to Brad on multiple occasions. When I informed him that Savannah had been gossiping about the relationship and even making jokes at his expense while still involved with him, he thanked me but never confirmed or denied it. Regardless, his favoritism toward her persisted long after she claimed the relationship ended.  

**Impact:**  
- Staff directly witnessed Savannah’s admissions, linking Brad’s favoritism to a personal/sexual relationship.  
- This undermined trust in the fairness of promotions, scheduling, and discipline.  
- **Policy Violation:** Conflict of interest, fraternization, and professional conduct.  
- **Law Violation:** EEOC guidance identifies sexual favoritism as sex discrimination if it disadvantages others in terms of equal treatment and opportunities.  

**Counterpoints — Origin of Favoritism**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “This is just rumor about a relationship.”  
  - **Response:** Multiple employees and an AM3 heard Savannah’s own statements over several weeks. Even absent confirmation, the *perception* created by her admissions has already harmed trust and fairness.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “This sounds personal.”  
  - **Response:** The impact is store-wide (scheduling, promotions, discipline, morale) and corroborated by multiple witnesses.

## 2. Favoritism Toward Savannah  

**Scheduling and Workload**  
- Savannah is rarely scheduled on weekends, and her shifts are tailored to her needs.  
- Her workload is consistently lighter than anyone else’s, leaving others to pick up the slack.  

**Workload Shielding**  
- When Brad is present, he prevents me (as Manager-on-Duty) from holding Savannah accountable.  
- She is scheduled for weekly Tuesday shifts as a proving ground for advancement but cannot handle them without Brad covering her responsibilities.  

**Abuse of Staff**  
- On Sundays (every other weekend) when Brad is absent, Savannah has repeatedly mistreated staff by:  
  - Spending as much time as possible on her phone instead of managing.  
  - Screaming at employees about her personal life drama during shifts.  
  - Screaming at employees when they ask reasonable, work-related questions.  
- Multiple employees and managers have witnessed this behavior firsthand.  
- Her conduct creates a **hostile work environment**, driving down morale and making staff afraid to approach her with legitimate concerns.  
- Despite repeated incidents, Brad has taken no action to correct or discipline her.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates company policies on professionalism, respectful workplace behavior, and supervisory standards.  
- Breaches her responsibility as a manager to de-escalate and support employees, not abuse them.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- Meets EEOC criteria for creating a *hostile work environment* through repeated abusive behavior by a manager.  
- Employees quitting due to her treatment (including the AM2 resignation) strengthens claims of **constructive discharge.**  
- Brad’s knowledge and refusal to act may expose the company to **negligent supervision/retention liability.**  
- OSHA’s General Duty Clause could apply, as her conduct contributes to an unsafe psychological environment.  

**Accountability Double Standard**  
- Savannah frequently arrives late (5 minutes to 1.5 hours) and even no-call/no-shows, but Brad excuses her behavior.  
- I attempted to write her up for a no-call/no-show, but Brad blocked the write-up.  
- Other employees are held to stricter standards, reinforcing the perception that misconduct is tolerated when it comes from her.  

**Promotion and Advancement Disparities**  
- The AM progression system requires AM1s to run shifts independently before promotion.  
- I waited over 9 months to advance from AM1 → AM2, running entire shifts alone (sometimes with no employees).  
- Savannah has failed to meet these requirements but is still being pushed forward by Brad, who has even tried to help her bypass testing.  

**Authority Bias**  
- Brad defers to Savannah’s judgment even when she is wrong.  
- He undermines other managers’ authority by taking her side against them.  

**Impact on Staff and Culture**  
- All staff openly acknowledge the past relationship and favoritism.  
- Employees no longer report Savannah’s misconduct to Brad, knowing she is protected. Instead, they bring issues to me, though my authority is undermined by Brad.  
- Morale is severely damaged; staff express open frustration and disengagement.  
- Turnover has increased — including the resignation of a long-tenured AM2 within the past week.  

**Counterpoints — Favoritism**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Managers have discretion in scheduling/discipline.”  
  - **Response:** Discretion must be applied consistently. Here, it’s applied to protect one AM while others face stricter standards and consequences.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “This is a personality clash.”  
  - **Response:** The pattern is systemic, witnessed by multiple employees, and tied to operational failures and turnover.

## 3. Unsafe Working Conditions  

**Chronic Understaffing**  
- The store is rarely adequately staffed.  
- Employees are routinely denied breaks because of workload.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates company standards for safe and effective staffing.  
- Prevents managers from meeting service metrics without overworking staff.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *FLSA:* Breaks under 20 minutes must be paid; denial of breaks during long shifts may constitute a wage/hour violation.  
- *OSHA:* Forcing employees to work through breaks in extreme heat conditions is a recognized hazard.  

---

**Extreme Heat from Oven and Poor Ventilation**  
- A 520-degree oven runs constantly with inadequate ventilation.  
- Store temperatures exceed 85°F daily; during AC failures (recurring), temps rise above 95°F+ for multiple hours during dinner rush.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Fails to maintain safe, comfortable workplace conditions.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA General Duty Clause:* Employers are required to protect workers from recognized hazards, including indoor heat stress. Prolonged work at >95°F without breaks violates OSHA standards for heat illness prevention.  

---

**Break Denial / Unreasonable Conditions**  
- Company policy requires breaks, but because of chronic understaffing and workload, breaks are functionally impossible until late at night (if at all).  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Company break policy is not enforced.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *FLSA:* Breaks shorter than 20 minutes must be counted as paid work time. If employees are not allowed breaks, this may constitute uncompensated labor.  
- *OSHA:* Denying rest in extreme heat increases risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.  

---

**Unresolved Building Hazards (Roof Leak / Wet Floors)**  
- The roof has leaked for at least five years, creating persistent slip hazards.  
- Despite repeated reports, the issue has not been fixed.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Failure to maintain facilities safely.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Requires floors to be dry and free of slip hazards. Persistent leaks without correction constitute a violation.  
- *Premises Liability:* If a customer were injured, the company could face civil liability.  

---

**Walk-In Cooler Structural Risk**  
- The walk-in cooler is not structurally sound and may be at risk of collapsing.  
- This poses both a **life-safety hazard** (risk of crushing or entrapment for employees inside or nearby) and a **food safety hazard** (improper storage temperatures).  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Fails company facility standards for safe, operational equipment.  
- Endangers employee safety and product integrity.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Structural hazards that risk collapse fall under the General Duty Clause for workplace safety.  
- *FDA / Health Code:* Unsafe cooler conditions threaten food safety compliance, risking citations or shutdown by health inspectors.  
- *Negligence Liability:* If the cooler collapses and injures an employee, the company would face direct liability for knowingly ignoring the hazard.  

---

**Leadership Breakdown in Hazard Reporting**  
- Employees no longer trust Savannah to handle hazards.  
- Reports to Brad are often dismissed or ignored, leaving issues unresolved.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Breaks the chain of responsibility for hazard reporting.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Ignoring reported hazards is considered willful neglect, which carries higher penalties.  

**Counterpoints — Unsafe Working Conditions**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Facilities issues aren’t Brad’s fault.”  
  - **Response:** The issue is his *failure to escalate and resolve* despite repeated reports and ongoing risks to staff and customers.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Breaks aren’t mandated by Alabama law.”  
  - **Response:** Federal standards (FLSA/OSHA) still apply; denying rest in high heat is a recognized safety hazard.  

---

## 4. Overwork  

**Excessive Hours / Long Shifts**  
- I have personally worked shifts from **07:30 AM until 03:00 AM** (19+ hours).  
- I and the AM3 have worked “clopens” (close then open) and “open-closes” (open through close in one day).  
- Combined with understaffing and extreme heat, these shifts create exhaustion, unsafe conditions, and higher risk of errors or accidents.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Company policy requires managers to ensure employees are scheduled within reasonable limits. Forcing extreme hours undermines health, safety, and productivity.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *FLSA:* Extended shifts without adequate breaks or recovery time may violate federal wage and hour protections. If employees are pressured to work through meals or rest, that constitutes uncompensated labor.  
- *OSHA:* Fatigue is recognized as a workplace hazard. Combining extreme hours with heat exposure heightens liability under OSHA’s General Duty Clause.  

---

**Unrealistic Staffing During Peak Volume**  
- On multiple occasions, only I and the AM3 staffed the inside during **Friday night dinner rush** (the busiest shift of the week).  
- While the company sets no minimum staffing, operational reality requires at least three employees for dinner rush on any day, and four employees Thursday–Sunday, to meet delivery times and service metrics.  
- Running Friday rush with only two people set us up to fail — impossible expectations under dangerous levels of overwork.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Fails to schedule adequate labor to meet company service and safety standards.  
- Forces managers into no-win scenarios where meeting goals is impossible.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Understaffing that results in employees skipping breaks, working while fatigued, or cutting corners under unsafe heat may constitute a recognized hazard.  
- *Negligence Liability:* If service failures or safety incidents occur, the company could be found negligent for knowingly understaffing peak periods.  

---

**Retaliation and Emotional Manipulation**  
- When staff resist or question hours, Brad uses emotional manipulation to guilt or pressure them into compliance.  
- Savannah often runs to Brad with complaints; Brad then pressures other employees into covering for her or for himself.  
- Staff feel coerced into working unreasonable hours to avoid retaliation or being seen as disloyal.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates standards of professional conduct and leadership expectations.  
- Undermines voluntary scheduling policies by coercing compliance.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *FLSA:* Coerced “voluntary” overtime without proper pay can constitute a violation.  
- *EEOC Retaliation Standards:* If employees who refuse extra hours are punished or treated unfairly, it may be considered retaliation.  
- *Constructive Discharge:* Employees who quit due to persistent manipulation or impossible workloads may claim they were forced out under intolerable conditions.  

---

**Impact on Health and Team**  
- Overwork, lack of rest, and extreme heat combine to create unsafe levels of fatigue.  
- Morale continues to erode, with employees burning out or quitting under pressure.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates company commitments to workplace safety and employee retention.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Employers must address hazards contributing to health risks, including fatigue and heat-related illness.  
- *Workers’ Compensation Risk:* Fatigue-induced mistakes or heat-related health incidents could expose the company to liability if tied to unsafe scheduling.  

**Counterpoints — Overwork**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Those 19-hour shifts were rare.”  
  - **Response:** Even one such shift is unsafe; the system allows it to happen at all, and it co-occurs with heat and no breaks.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “People agreed to cover.”  
  - **Response:** Agreements obtained through guilt/pressure aren’t voluntary and undermine wage/hour protections.  

---

## 5. Policy Violations  

**Blocking of Disciplinary Action**  
- I documented a no-call/no-show by Savannah and attempted to write her up. Brad blocked the write-up.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates company standards for consistent discipline and accountability.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *EEOC / Retaliation Risk:* Uneven application of discipline based on favoritism may constitute discriminatory practice.  
- *Negligent Supervision:* Protecting an employee with known misconduct exposes the company to liability if further incidents occur.  

---

**Tampering with Advancement Process**  
- Brad has pushed for Savannah’s promotion despite her failure to meet AM1 progression requirements and attempted to help her bypass required testing.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Undermines the integrity of the company’s promotion system.  
- Creates inequity for employees who followed proper procedure.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *EEOC:* Sexual favoritism in advancement is a form of sex discrimination, disadvantaging others.  

---

**Failure to Maintain Facility Standards**  
- The roof leak creating wet floors has been ignored for years despite repeated reports.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Breaches company’s facility and safety maintenance obligations.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Ongoing slip hazards without correction are violations.  
- *Premises Liability:* Company could be held liable for employee or customer injuries.  

---

**Fraternization and Conflict of Interest**  
- Brad engaged in a personal/sexual relationship with Savannah, violating company standards on fraternization.  
- The resulting favoritism is a direct conflict of interest.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Breaches conflict-of-interest and professional conduct policies.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *EEOC:* Sexual favoritism constitutes sex discrimination if it creates disadvantage for others.  

---

**Failure to Enforce Break Policies**  
- Employees are effectively denied breaks due to understaffing and workload, in violation of company break policy.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Ignores corporate commitment to employee welfare and rest.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *FLSA:* Break time must be compensated if under 20 minutes.  
- *OSHA:* Break denial in high-heat conditions constitutes unsafe labor practice.  

---

**Suppression of Hazard Reporting**  
- Employees avoid reporting to Savannah due to her incompetence. Reports to Brad are ignored. This leaves hazards unresolved.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates chain of command for hazard escalation.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- *OSHA:* Ignoring hazard reports is considered willful neglect.  

**Counterpoints — Policy Violations**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Managers have flexibility to handle discipline and promotions.”  
  - **Response:** Flexibility isn’t a license to ignore policy requirements or testing. Consistency and documentation are required.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “We didn’t know about the hazards.”  
  - **Response:** Hazards were repeatedly reported; failure to act is documented and ongoing.  

---

## 6. Leadership & Communication Failures  

**Excusing Misconduct**  
- When I raise concerns about Savannah’s behavior, Brad repeatedly makes excuses in private conversations.  
- He dismisses her explosive conduct as me being “too harsh” or “biased” in my analysis, even though staff have also reported her behavior.  
- This selective defense undermines accountability and shows favoritism over fair leadership.  

**Selective Professionalism**  
- Savannah behaves professionally when Brad is present, proving she is capable of controlling herself.  
- When Brad is absent, she reverts to tantrums, lateness, and verbal abuse toward staff.  
- This selective behavior contradicts Brad’s claim that she “lacks the ability” to manage herself, demonstrating that her conduct is a choice, not a limitation.  

**Breakdowns in Scheduling Communication**  
- Nearly every shift I run, Brad fails to notify me of staff call-outs, despite my repeated requests for proper communication.  
- I enter shifts unaware of actual staffing levels and must scramble to secure coverage myself.  
- This creates unnecessary chaos, undermines my ability to plan, and contributes to unsafe understaffing.  

**Manipulative Scheduling Tactics**  
- Brad routinely uses guilt to pressure managers into covering shifts by claiming he will otherwise be forced to cover repeated “open-close-open” (O-C-O) shifts.  
- After I and others agree to help, we discover he has applied the same manipulation to multiple managers, leaving him free of shifts while we each absorb “voluntary” understaffed workloads.  
- This deception shifts responsibility for his own poor planning onto others and erodes trust in his leadership.  

**Savannah’s Chronic Failures While Running Shifts**  
- Every shift Savannah runs results in staff abuse, lateness, or neglect.  
- She is consistently later than any other employee I’ve encountered, often by significant margins.  
- When in charge, she frequently ignores responsibilities, mistreats staff, and fails to provide basic operational support.  

**Staff Reactions and Morale**  
- Non-management staff routinely joke about Savannah’s incompetence and mistreatment of employees when she and Brad are absent.  
- I often overhear staff retelling incidents to one another in tones of disbelief, only to confide in me with details when I ask.  
- These ongoing conversations confirm that morale is collapsing and that staff no longer trust Brad or Savannah to lead effectively.  

**Impact:**  
- Management is perceived as inconsistent, manipulative, and untrustworthy.  
- Authority is undermined when misconduct is excused and hazards ignored.  
- Scheduling failures and manipulative coverage tactics create burnout and resentment.  
- Staff disengagement and turnover are accelerating, directly tied to these leadership failures.  

**Counterpoints — Leadership & Communication Failures**  
- **HR Weak Point:** “This is just a management style difference.”  
  - **Response:** These failures cause measurable operational harm: understaffed peak shifts, unresolved hazards, unplanned coverage gaps, and resignations.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Employees could have escalated concerns.”  
  - **Response:** They tried. Brad ignored reports, dismissed concerns, and blocked accountability. Staff now avoid him entirely, leaving me as the default point of escalation without authority to resolve issues.  
- **HR Weak Point:** “Savannah’s behavior is unintentional or due to inexperience.”  
  - **Response:** Her ability to behave professionally when Brad is present shows her misconduct is deliberate, not inability. It is a choice made when she believes she won’t face consequences.  

---

## Summary  

Over the past 9 months, Brad has engaged in repeated favoritism toward Savannah rooted in a personal/sexual relationship, undermining accountability and advancement processes. He has failed to address unsafe working conditions (extreme heat, leaks, denied breaks, structural risks), enforced extreme overwork through understaffing and manipulation, violated company policies, and fostered a toxic culture of mistrust and resentment.  

These issues affect the entire team, not just me. Multiple employees have witnessed and experienced the consequences, and turnover is increasing as a direct result. The pattern of conduct poses significant risks to employee safety, legal compliance, and the company’s reputation.

# Exhibits  

## Running Index  

- **Exhibit 001 (08/31/25):** Savannah Abusing Staff — checkout incident with Joey (witnessed by Erick).  
- **Exhibit 002 (Jun–Aug 2025):** Savannah’s Chronic Lateness and Attendance Failures — documented by personal texts and attendance log.  

---

## Exhibit 001 — Savannah Abusing Staff (08/31/25)  

**Date:** August 31, 2025  
**Witnesses:**  
- **Joey** — new driver from another franchise store; voluntarily covering shifts due to understaffing (not obligated).  
- **Erick** — in-store employee on shift under Savannah’s supervision; observed the interaction in full.  
**Source:** Joey’s contemporaneous phone call to me and follow-up texts (screenshotted); Erick’s in-person observations (written statement to be collected).  

**Background:**  
- Joey is relatively new and had not been informed during rushed training that personal checks are not accepted.  
- During a chaotic, understaffed shift, he mistakenly accepted a **personal check** on a delivery.  

**Incident Details:**  
- At checkout, Savannah discovered the check. Joey explained he didn’t know the policy.  
- Savannah snapped: *“This isn’t the 1980s anymore, nobody takes checks, you should know that.”*  
- Joey offered to cover the amount from his cash tips; Savannah said: *“Oh yeah, you’re going to, because I’m not going to end up short on money because of you,”* then walked away.  
- When Joey asked to be checked out so he could leave, Savannah replied: *“Look at the board, I’m not checking you out right now.”* (orders pending were not Joey’s responsibility).  
- Joey suggested leaving the money for later processing; Savannah ignored him, retrieved earbuds, and put them in—**Erick witnessed** this deliberate dismissal—leaving Joey standing there.  
- Joey left his cash tips with Savannah and departed.  

**Aftermath:**  
- On the drive home, Joey called me, apologized for not knowing the policy, and said he didn’t feel the mistake warranted being “snapped on.”  
- Follow-up texts reiterate his account and tone (apologetic; not trying to “cause anything”).  

**Behavioral Issues Documented:**  
- **Verbal abuse and humiliation** of a new employee.  
- **Neglect of duty** (refusal to perform end-of-shift checkout).  
- **Unprofessional conduct** (earbuds/intentional ignoring).  
- **Hostile environment** effect on a voluntary helper during a staffing crisis.  

**Impact:**  
- Demoralizes a helpful, voluntary extra set of hands; risks losing substitute labor during understaffing.  
- Reinforces staff perception that Savannah mistreats employees without consequence.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates respectful workplace, professionalism, and supervisory-duty policies; failure to coach/correct constructively.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- Contributes to a **hostile work environment** pattern; Brad’s inaction despite repeated reports increases **negligent supervision/retention** exposure.

### Witness Statement — Erick  

I, **Erick [Last Name]**, was working in-store under Assistant Manager Savannah on **August 31, 2025** when I witnessed her interaction with Joey during checkout at the end of his shift. Joey attempted to check out and explained that he had mistakenly accepted a personal check during a delivery. Savannah responded by snapping, “This isn’t the 1980s anymore, nobody takes checks, you should know that.” When Joey offered to cover the check from his cash tips, Savannah replied, “Oh yeah, you’re going to, because I’m not going to end up short on money because of you,” then walked away. When Joey asked her to finish checking him out so he could leave, Savannah said, “Look at the board, I’m not checking you out right now.” Joey then asked if he could just leave the money, and Savannah ignored him, put in her earbuds, and walked away. I observed this interaction in full.

### Witness Statement — Joey  

I, **Joey [Last Name]**, was working a delivery shift at [Store Location] on **August 31, 2025**, voluntarily filling in to help with understaffing. During checkout at the end of my shift, Savannah confronted me about a personal check I had mistakenly accepted on a delivery. I explained that I was new and had not been told during training that personal checks were not accepted. Savannah snapped, “This isn’t the 1980s anymore, nobody takes checks, you should know that.” I offered to cover the amount of the check from my cash tips. She replied, “Oh yeah, you’re going to, because I’m not going to end up short on money because of you,” and walked away. When I asked her to finish checking me out so I could leave, she said, “Look at the board, I’m not checking you out right now.” I asked if I could leave the money for her to process later, and she ignored me, put in her earbuds, and walked away. I left my cash tips with her and went home. This interaction made me feel disrespected and singled out for a training mistake that was not my fault.

### Incident Statement — Corey  

On **August 31, 2025**, I received a phone call from Joey shortly after he left the store. He reported that during checkout, Savannah had snapped at him for mistakenly accepting a personal check, saying, “This isn’t the 1980s anymore, nobody takes checks, you should know that.” Joey explained to me that he was new, had not been informed of this policy during training, and was willing to cover the check from his cash tips. He told me Savannah responded, “Oh yeah, you’re going to, because I’m not going to end up short on money because of you,” before refusing to complete his checkout.  

Joey further told me that when he asked if he could leave the money and go, Savannah ignored him, walked away, and put in her earbuds. He said he felt disrespected and made to feel like he was at fault for the poor training he had received during a chaotic staffing period. In text messages after his shift, Joey repeated this account and apologized to me for “causing trouble,” even though he was the victim of her conduct.  

I also confirmed with Erick, an in-store employee, that he had witnessed the interaction in full.

## Exhibit 002 — Savannah’s Chronic Lateness and Attendance Failures (Jun–Aug 2025)  

**Date Range:** June–August 2025  
**Sources:**  
- Direct text messages from Savannah (screenshots, June 6–August 2, 2025).  
- Internal attendance log compiled from store records (screenshots, June 1–August 31, 2025).  

**Incident Details:**  
- Savannah was late to the majority of her scheduled shifts during this period, often by more than 15 minutes and sometimes by over an hour.  
- Documented **no-call/no-show** occurred on **August 2, 2025**.  
- Multiple shifts show lateness between **+20 minutes and +90 minutes**, well outside the tolerated 15-minute grace period.  
- In several cases, Savannah texted last-minute excuses (e.g., transportation issues, personal emergencies) instead of providing advance notice.  

**Behavioral Issues Documented:**  
- **Chronic lateness:** Consistently late by more than the tolerated 15-minute window.  
- **Attendance unreliability:** Frequent late arrivals and at least one no-call/no-show.  
- **Excuse-making:** Excuses provided after the fact instead of accountability or planning.  

**Impact:**  
- Repeated lateness and no-shows left shifts critically understaffed.  
- Increased workload for present staff, driving fatigue and resentment.  
- Damaged morale due to double standards, as other employees face consequences for similar or lesser infractions.  

**Policy Ramifications:**  
- Violates company policies on punctuality and attendance.  
- Forces other employees to cover responsibilities last-minute, undermining fairness and trust.  

**Legal Ramifications:**  
- While not a direct FLSA/OSHA violation on its own, this behavior contributes to unsafe understaffing, which ties into heat stress, break denial, and overwork violations already outlined in Section 3 (Unsafe Working Conditions) and Section 4 (Overwork).

### Incident Statement — Corey  

Between **June 1 and August 31, 2025**, Savannah was late or absent for the majority of her scheduled shifts. This is documented in her own text messages to staff and in the attendance log I compiled from store records. The log shows repeated late arrivals well beyond the tolerated 15-minute window and at least one no-call/no-show on August 2, 2025.  

Her chronic lateness left shifts understaffed and placed additional burdens on employees who were on time. Staff regularly expressed frustration that Savannah faced no consequences, even as others were disciplined for similar or lesser attendance issues. Brad not only ignored this pattern but also blocked disciplinary actions against her, reinforcing the double standard.
